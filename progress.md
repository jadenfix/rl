Progress log — RLaaS implementation

2025-09-18
- 16:05 PDT — Reviewed `plan.md` and `roadmap.md` to understand pillars, phases, and MVP scope; identified need for explicit crosswalk plus immediate action list.
- 16:12 PDT — Added "Implementation alignment" section to `plan.md` (`plan.md:7`) summarizing how roadmap phases map onto plan pillars and captured the three Phase 0 critical actions.
- 16:18 PDT — Reintroduced structural divider (`plan.md:19`) to maintain readability after the new section.
- 16:22 PDT — Annotated `roadmap.md` Phase 0–2 blocks with live status notes tying them to the Plan P0 steps and clarifying which workstreams are blocked or pending (`roadmap.md:9`, `roadmap.md:23`, `roadmap.md:35`).
- 16:29 PDT — Scaffolded monorepo directories and placeholder service READMEs across gateway, reward, trainer, dashboard, and SDK apps; added repo-level docs, `.gitignore`, and pre-commit tooling (`apps/gateway/README.md`, `apps/reward/README.md`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
- 16:36 PDT — Introduced docker-compose stack with placeholder Python HTTP services, Prometheus/Grafana observability, env template, and Makefile automation for `make up/down/logs/seed` (`docker-compose.yml`, `config/.env.example`, `Makefile`).
- 16:42 PDT — Defined Postgres schema + seed routines for tenants, API keys, policies, and bootstrap events to satisfy Phase 0 gate (`config/db/init.sql`, `config/db/seed.sql`).
- 16:48 PDT — Attempted `make up`; run blocked because Docker daemon unavailable in sandbox. Documented command in `progress.md` and ensured `.env` copied locally for future runs.
- 16:55 PDT — Authored Phase 0 smoke-test procedure detailing bring-up, health checks, and seed verification for developers with Docker access (`docs/SMOKE_TEST.md`, `docs/README.md:9`).
- 17:00 PDT — Second `make up` attempt still blocked by Mac sandbox (permission denied on Docker socket); requires running outside CLI sandbox or granting socket access manually.
- 17:08 PDT — User ran `make up` locally; stack containers are up per Docker output. Pending manual health checks and seed verification (see `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md`).
- 17:15 PDT — Authored JSON Schemas for all Phase 1 events (`config/schemas/events/*.json`) to align SDK contracts with plan data model.
- 17:24 PDT — Added FastAPI-based telemetry collector with Pydantic models, validation endpoint, Docker image, and Prometheus scraping (`apps/collector/app`, `apps/collector/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml:4`).
- 17:30 PDT — Outlined Python/TypeScript SDK workplan covering transport, buffering, schema typing, and shared tasks (`docs/SDK_TASKS.md`).
- 17:38 PDT — Connected to Neon Postgres instance and executed schema + seed scripts successfully (`config/db/init.sql`, `config/db/seed.sql`), enabling remote tenant bootstrap.
- 2025-09-19 12:15 PDT — Verified Neon seed data via psql (tenant `acme-support`, api key `acme-support-key`, policy `support-draft-v0` @ `shadow` status).
- 2025-09-19 12:18 PDT — User confirmed local `/healthz` checks across gateway, reward, trainer, and collector services (Phase 0 gate closed).
- 2025-09-19 12:28 PDT — Wired collector persistence through connection-pooled Postgres writes with optional MinIO staging hooks (`apps/collector/app/main.py`, `apps/collector/app/storage.py`, `apps/collector/requirements.txt`).
- 2025-09-19 12:35 PDT — Updated docs and configuration to reflect remote Postgres workflow and ingestion smoke tests (`README.md`, `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md`, `.env`).

Current focus
- Implement collector cold-storage (MinIO) staging, expose OpenAPI artifacts, and start Python SDK transport based on shared schemas.

Next checkpoints
- Enable MinIO-backed batch staging and document retention workflow.
- Scaffold Python SDK core client (httpx transport + retries) and associated tests.
